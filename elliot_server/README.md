The elliot server is a basic Flask application that implements the API endpoints described in the YAML file:
### Explanation

1. **Upload Dataset**:
   - Endpoint: `/datasets`
   - Method: POST
   - Description: Uploads a dataset file and stores it in memory.

2. **Create Experiment**:
   - Endpoint: `/experiments`
   - Method: POST
   - Description: Creates a new experiment with the provided configuration.

3. **Get Experiment Results**:
   - Endpoint: `/experiments/<experiment_id>`
   - Method: GET
   - Description: Retrieves results of a specified experiment.

4. **Delete Experiment**:
   - Endpoint: `/experiments/<experiment_id>`
   - Method: DELETE
   - Description: Deletes a specified experiment.

5. **Generate Recommendations**:
   - Endpoint: `/recommendations`
   - Method: POST
   - Description: Generates recommendations for a user based on a specified model.

6. **Train Model**:
   - Endpoint: `/models`
   - Method: POST
   - Description: Initiates training of a new model with the provided configuration.

7. **Get Model Details**:
   - Endpoint: `/models/<model_id>`
   - Method: GET
   - Description: Retrieves details of a specified model.

8. **Delete Model**:
   - Endpoint: `/models/<model_id>`
   - Method: DELETE
   - Description: Deletes a specified model.

9. **Retrieve Metrics**:
   - Endpoint: `/metrics`
   - Method: GET
   - Description: Retrieves evaluation metrics for a specified experiment.

TODO: This basic implementation stores data in memory, which is suitable for a prototype or initial development. For a production-ready service, you would need to implement persistent storage, error handling, authentication, and other necessary features.

====================================================================

To run the elliot server, follow these steps:

### Running the Flask Application
1. **Install Flask**:
   Make sure you have Flask installed. You can install it using pip if it's not already installed:
   ```sh
   pip install Flask
   ```

2. **Set the FLASK_APP Environment Variable**:
   Depending on your operating system, set the `FLASK_APP` environment variable to point to your Flask application file.
   - **Windows**:
     ```sh
     set FLASK_APP=app.py
     ```
   - **macOS/Linux**:
     ```sh
     export FLASK_APP=app.py
     ```

3. **Run the Flask Application**:
   Use the following command to run your Flask application:
   ```sh
   flask run
   ```

### Example Command Sequence
```sh
pip install Flask
export FLASK_APP=app.py  # Use `set` instead of `export` on Windows
flask run
```

### Accessing the Application
Once the application is running, it will be accessible by default at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`. You can use your browser or tools like `curl` or Postman to interact with the API endpoints.

This basic setup will get your Flask application up and running, allowing you to develop and test your SaaS offering based on the Elliot framework.
